#Using Job\_Info

Create a .txt file for each job you are applying to, titled with the name of the job. 

Copy and paste information about the job into this file. This can be the job description, company values, and/or your own description. The AI Agent's goal is to extract the most important skills for the job! 

Feel free to move a job to the "Old\_Apps" folder if you do not want it to be an option. Move it out at any time.

__Only files ending in .txt will be used by the app, all other files will be ignored__
